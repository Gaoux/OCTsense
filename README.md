# OCTsense

OCTsense is a **web platform (SPA)** for the **automated analysis of OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images** using **artificial intelligence**.
It is designed for **ophthalmologists** who need support diagnosing ocular diseases such as **C, AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration)**, macular edema, and others ‚Äî **without depending on image experts**.

OCTsense is a **web platform (SPA)** for the **automated analysis of OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images** using artificial intelligence.
It is designed for ophthalmologists or patients who need support diagnosing ocular conditions, specifically detecting:
Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Drusen lesions (DRUSEN), and identifying Healthy retinal tissue ‚Äî without depending on image experts.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

Follow these steps to install and run the project locally:

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-folder
```

---

## 2. Backend (Django + PostgreSQL)

The backend code for OCTsense is located in a separate repository. You can find it here:

**Backend Repository:** [OCTsense Backend](https://your-backend-repository-link)

Follow the instructions in that repository to set up and run the backend server locally.

---

## 3. Frontend (React + Vite)

### a. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend folder:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

---

### b. Run Frontend with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Frontend will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

# ‚ú® Extra Notes

- AI models are managed separately inside the backend (`oct/predict/` endpoint).
- Make sure ports **8000 (backend)** and **3000 (frontend)** are open.
- For production, it's recommended to serve the frontend using **Nginx** (already set up).
